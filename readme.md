1 - In this project, I managed to get all the recipes when the generate button is clicked, then I was working to get the details of the recipe but I took me a long time because I was stcak. I forgot to put the id in the parent element and nothing worked for 3h, it was terrible. When I got that, I tried to loop through the arrays of steps and ingredient but unfortunately I couldn't get them as a list.

2 - I think it's not really, the modal doesn't work preoperly. When I open a new modal and I click outside, it disappears but when I open another one, the previous one also appears unless I refresh the page before I open a new one.


3 - If I had more time, I would improve my css and make the form work so that it can generate a new recipe everytime we add inputs.
